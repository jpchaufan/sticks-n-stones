intended game-play:

	food is another survival priority. the player can forage and hunt to get food. 
	player figures things out based on simple grunts and utterances made by the character as they click on things and do stuff

	the player gains exp in the various skills as they play, and become better at those survival tasks, and can collect more and better materials.
	soon they get access to more abilities such as crafting, planting, fishing, etc.

build plan: 
	game world will be sectioned into world fragments. ( at first, only the main world fragment needs to be made )
	each fragment will hold everything in it, having its own array for each thing. animals likely will stick to their territory ( world fragment )
	drawing and collision checks will only need to occur for things overlapping the world fragments the camera is colliding with.

	there will be a simple game UI with no menus:
