Sticks and Stones is a game about nomadic wilderness survival and exploration.

The player is a nomadic caveman exploring the world as a lone scout, who relies on his wits and skills, not high-quality equipment, to survive and explore the world.

Scouting, tracking, hunting, and trapping allow the player to acquire food and other resources. The player is also on the receiving end at times, when large cats or wolves may stalk the player. 

Foraging and gathering is also important, as the player must collect plant foods and materials for survival.

The player gains experience in a variety of skills as he practices, including possibly:
Hunting
Skinning
Firemaking
Stonework
Crafting
Herbalism
Tracking
Stealth
Fishing

A possible fantasy element would include:
different races associated with each of the five elements - fire, air, water, wood, and mineral
and associated bonuses and types of magic abilities




next steps:

Temperature Regulation System:

1. if current temp is below a bottom threshhold of 10 C, the temp meter will turn blue and start to drop.
2. it will drop by as much as 10% for each degree below threshhold that it is, and will drop faster, the bigger the difference
EX. so if it is 6 C, it will drop to as low as 60%. 
So, you can only die when it is at least 0 or less, since that would be enough to drop to 0% temp rating.

3. doing certain things will affect the effective day temp effect on your body.
EX. being near a fire will raise the effective degree by 2 for each level of intensity. Thus, a 0 C day will feel like 10 C if you are near a fire of intensity 5.






















OLD NOTES

Sticks and Stones

A simple wilderness survival game

features:
	procedurally generated maps with water.
	procedurally generated music

	health, hunger, thirst, and temperature meters

	time heals, food fills, water refreshes, and fire warms

	skills:
		stones lvl - stone throwing power / speed / accuracy, build strong and durable walls

	use stones to throw and to build walls
	use sticks to swing and to start / fuel fires
	forage for edible berries and leaves and roots
	hunt for meat
	stash items in trees and rocks


extra features:
	plant seeds and grow crops and trees
	collect hides to keep warm and craft bags
	collect bones to make spears for stabbing and fishing
	cooking takes time, nearness to the fire speeds cooking time, food can burn
	find stumps and make coal-burned cup / bowl, to carry water and make soup
	swimming to cool off
	? food spoilage ?
	seasons and seasonal events -
		like rains and blizzards, rabid wolf attacks, heat waves 

basic items: 
	stones, sticks, fruits, nuts, leaves, roots / tubers, meat, cooked versions of foods... ~ 10 total
extra items:
	seeds, hides, bones, raw fish, cooked fish, wood chunk, cup / bowl, bowl of water, bowl of soup

intended game-play: 
	player must find water as a priority to deal with thirst, and light a fire to keep warm during the night.
	food is another survival priority. the player can forage and hunt to get food. 
	player figures things out based on simple grunts and utterances made by the character as they click on things and do stuff

	the player gains exp in the various skills as they play, and become better at those survival tasks, and can collect more and better materials.
	soon they get access to more abilities such as crafting, planting, fishing, etc.

build plan: 
	game world will be sectioned into world fragments. ( at first, only the main world fragment needs to be made )
	each fragment will hold everything in it, having its own array for each thing. animals likely will stick to their territory ( world fragment )
	drawing and collision checks will only need to occur for things overlapping the world fragments the camera is colliding with.

	there will be a simple game UI with no menus:

	|______________________________|

	just click on items to select them and click on the screen to use them
	go near water to auto drink it
	make fire to cook food and keep warm and have light at night

	some plants will be spikey or poisonous and hurt the player. plant skills help deal with these.
	some animals will be dangerous and fight back, or even hunt the player.


How Plants and Seasons Will Work:
	- seasons will last 1 month
	- the temperature algorithm numbers will vary based on seasons / months

	- plants can spawn during warm temps, such as spring and summer-like temps
	- based on accumulated temperature days, plants mature and produce edible fruits and roots
	- in cold enough temps, plants die

	- deciduous trees gain and lose leaves
	- evergreens keep leaves year round
	- grass tiles become snow

	- micro biomes can be created after this, each polygon generating an evergreen, deciduous, or meadow micro biome

	additionally:
	- herbs and flowers should be rendered 'before', to appear under the player
	- they should not collide, but maybe slow movement




To Do Log:

	set compass point

	better plant and food generation and availability

	number keys are hotkeys for selecting in inventory

	add thirst, hunger, and temperature, internally stored and expressed through Ug's speech, add drinking water and warming by fire

		- thirst, hunger, temp, and hp are all max at 1 and multiplied together to calculate overall vitality score
		- vitality score affects speed multiplicatively
		- if vitality is 0 (which happens when any 1 health indicator hits 0), you die
		- this encourages the player to stay healthy, as any imperfection in vitality means you walk slower and slower, till you die

		- high temp make you thirsty faster
		- cold temp makes you hungry faster
		- moving and working make you hungry and thirsty faster, and warm you up

	tree GDD growth and fruit production

	takes time to start walls or fires

	stash buttons show picture of the item, and you can choose how much to take

	limit storage

	re-add action button: / right click
		to attack with stick or stone,
		to 'inspect' items and things, getting game hints
		(or reverse buttons)

		hunter animals (like tigers or mountain lions) - chase player, out only at night and not near fire
		other animals: birds, fish, fishing, spiders...

	cooking

	add procedural music generation, add sound effects

	mouse cursor image, changes when hovering over clickables, or maybe when selecting

	refactor and clean
