extra items:
	seeds, hides, bones, raw fish, cooked fish, wood chunk, cup / bowl, bowl of water, bowl of soup

intended game-play: 
	player must find water as a priority to deal with thirst, and light a fire to keep warm during the night.
	food is another survival priority. the player can forage and hunt to get food. 
	player figures things out based on simple grunts and utterances made by the character as they click on things and do stuff

	the player gains exp in the various skills as they play, and become better at those survival tasks, and can collect more and better materials.
	soon they get access to more abilities such as crafting, planting, fishing, etc.

build plan: 
	game world will be sectioned into world fragments. ( at first, only the main world fragment needs to be made )
	each fragment will hold everything in it, having its own array for each thing. animals likely will stick to their territory ( world fragment )
	drawing and collision checks will only need to occur for things overlapping the world fragments the camera is colliding with.

	there will be a simple game UI with no menus:

	|______________________________|

	just click on items to select them and click on the screen to use them
	go near water to auto drink it
	make fire to cook food and keep warm and have light at night

	some plants will be spikey or poisonous and hurt the player. plant skills help deal with these.
	some animals will be dangerous and fight back, or even hunt the player.


How Plants and Seasons Will Work:
	- seasons will last 1 month
	- the temperature algorithm numbers will vary based on seasons / months

	- plants can spawn during warm temps, such as spring and summer-like temps
	- based on accumulated temperature days, plants mature and produce edible fruits and roots
	- in cold enough temps, plants die

	- deciduous trees gain and lose leaves
	- evergreens keep leaves year round
	- grass tiles become snow

	- micro biomes can be created after this, each polygon generating an evergreen, deciduous, or meadow micro biome

	additionally:
	- herbs and flowers should be rendered 'before', to appear under the player
	- they should not collide, but maybe slow movement




To Do Log:

	set compass point

	better plant and food generation and availability

	number keys are hotkeys for selecting in inventory

	add thirst, hunger, and temperature, internally stored and expressed through Ug's speech, add drinking water and warming by fire

		- thirst, hunger, temp, and hp are all max at 1 and multiplied together to calculate overall vitality score
		- vitality score affects speed multiplicatively
		- if vitality is 0 (which happens when any 1 health indicator hits 0), you die
		- this encourages the player to stay healthy, as any imperfection in vitality means you walk slower and slower, till you die

		- high temp make you thirsty faster
		- cold temp makes you hungry faster
		- moving and working make you hungry and thirsty faster, and warm you up

	tree GDD growth and fruit production

	takes time to start walls or fires

	stash buttons show picture of the item, and you can choose how much to take
