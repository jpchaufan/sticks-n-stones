Sticks and Stones is a game about nomadic wilderness survival and exploration.

The player is a nomadic caveman exploring the world as a lone scout, who relies on his wits and skills, not high-quality equipment, to survive and explore the world.

Scouting, tracking, hunting, and trapping allow the player to acquire food and other resources. The player is also on the receiving end at times, when large cats or wolves may stalk the player. 

Foraging and gathering is also important, as the player must collect plant foods and materials for survival.

The player gains experience in a variety of skills as he practices, including possibly:
Hunting
Skinning
Firemaking
Stonework
Crafting
Herbalism
Tracking
Stealth
Fishing

A possible fantasy element would include:
different races associated with each of the five elements - fire, air, water, wood, and mineral
and associated bonuses and types of magic abilities

Better Items:
items in stash have an image and a spoilage meter. left click to take all and right click to take one.
items on hand also have a spoilage bar.


Character Sheet: design and add a character sheet (c key to toggle)
that shows player skills and stats

Skills:
firemaking - allows for faster firemaking, and less chance of failure.
		lvl up by: making fires +++, fueling fires+

stalking - gives higher stealth rating
		lvl up by: stalking close to things+, stalking perceptive things++

tracking - ( need to add 'look around' action + animation ) (BIG)
			gives higher perception rating and gives more and better info on surroundings
			e.g. will give hints as to what animals belong to the current wf, 
			or even what direction there are certain animals or water.
			looking around gives a big temporary perception bonus, which then i can add wolves that hunt the player
			(since they will then be something you can defend against)
		lvl up by: looking around and finding things

skinning - faster skinning and better finds, e.g hides, bones, organs
		lvl up by: skinning animals+

botany - better plant inspection, collect more from plants, e.g. more leaves, seeds, fibers.
			allows me to add more plant varieties that can't be used until higher botany lvl
		lvl up by: foraging plants+, inspecting plants+

crafting - can make new items (BIG)
			right click on items to bring up a list of possible crafts. crafting level determines your chance of success.
			e.g. stone knife, fur poncho, bow, fire drill, arrows, etc.
			the possibilities really add up here.

cooking - allows faster cooking times and less burning, even when fire is hot. 
			like crafting, allows food items to be 'prepared', or combined into dishes that can then be cooked.


IDEA: there are base skills, which are connected to your character's total level. you level up base skills by doing them/
		BUT, as you hit character level breakpoints (eg lvl 5, 10, 15...), you get bonus abilities, which give extra bonus effects for customization

		possible abilities: cold tolerance, less thirsty, better carrying, better throwing




Plants Improvement: think through and make changes to plants. 
		make content management better for trees, and stones, too. maybe a daily step.
		make plants that spawn in new world fragments relate better to that year's cumulative gdd's.
		make plants more abundant, especially in spring, so plant foods are more realistically appealing.
		also, add many new plants, and the ability to make medicines and even eventually poisons.
